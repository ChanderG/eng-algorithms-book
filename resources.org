* Resources
** R1: CLRS Book
   Considered the most important book in algorithms.
   I find it too mathematical/theoretical/low level
** R2: Steven Skiena, The Algorithm Design Manual
   A more practical, high level approach.
** R3: C++ Reference
   http://www.cplusplus.com/reference
   Full manual for C++ standard libraries.
   Each function/method has examples too. Highly recommended.
